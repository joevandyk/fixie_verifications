FixieVerifications
==================

Easily add emailed verification to your application.  
Needs Rails 2.2 or Ruby 1.8.7 (for SecureRandom).


Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_verification_number 
end

u = User.create

# An email with a random code is sent to joe@fixieconsulting.com.
# Say the code is "12345"
u.needs_verification!("joe@fixieconsulting.com")  

# Either of these work
Verification.verify! "12345"
u.verify! "12345"

u.verified? # returns true
